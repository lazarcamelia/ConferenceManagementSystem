# ConferenceManagementSystem

Software Engineering program in teams. The requirements can be found here: 

The objective of a Conference Management System is to support the automatic
management of information related to scientific conferences. This information concern:
the authors submitting proposals, the members of the Program Committee, the
submissions' abstract and full papers proposed, meta-information about these, the
deadlines for different phases of sending proposals, assigning paper to reviewers,
evaluation deadline and announcing the results of paper valuation. Once the accepted
proposals are known, the different sections of the conference are decided; each accepted
paper is planned to be presented in a section. Each conference participant have to pay the
registration. The conference participants which can be: session chairs, speakers or
listeners.
Once a steering committee decides to organize a conference edition, the information about
the event is posted on the conference site. This information includes the name of the
conference, the interval in which the event will took place, the "Call for papers", the
deadlines, the Program Committee, the conference sections and program a. s. o.
Mainly there are 3 distinct phases regarding the management of the information preceded
by a preliminary phase, the PC members (including the conference chair or the conference
co-chairs) uploads information about their name, affiliation, email address, their personal
web-page, their username for the CMS and the password for accessing the information
about the conference. The chair or one of co-chairs have the permission to change
deadlines by postponing them to later data.
In the first phase, each person interested to submit a proposal create its own user account
fulfilling the information required (the name, affiliation, email address). Once the account
is validated, the submitter logins, submit the abstract and fulfills the meta-information
required: the name of the proposal, the keywords, the topics, the possible list of authors
and their meta-information). Depending on the conference it is possible to upload also the
full paper (usually a file in .pdf or .msword format). Uploading proposals can be done
before the deadline mentioned on the conference site and on the "Call for papers". It is
possible to have two different deadlines: one for the abstract and another for the proposal.
Until each deadline, users may upload new versions both for the abstract and the paper.
In the second phase, PC members are required to bid the proposals. Each PC member has
to do a brief analyze of abstracts or papers in order say if they are pleased to review some
papers, or if they are could evaluate some papers, or if they refuse to evaluate other papers.
Once the bidding process closed (there is a deadline for bidding), the conference chair or
co-chairs assign to each reviewer the papers required to be evaluated. By default any
reviewer do not receive for evaluation a paper refused in the bidding phase. At least two
different reviewers have to evaluate each paper. Usually there are three
reviewers(evaluators) for each paper but depending on the conference level there can be
also 4 reviewers. The result of each reviewer is one of the followings qualifiers: strong
accept, accept, weak accept, borderline paper, weak reject, reject and strong reject. The

papers whose evaluation do not contains any level of reject are accepted by default. Also
the papers do not containing any accept will be rejected. In case of papers having
contradictory evaluations the chair/co-chairs request reviewers to discuss in order to get
closer evaluations. If this will not be possible, is up to the chair to decide if another new
evaluation from a different reviewer will be required or if the paper will be rejected or
accepted. The evaluation qualifier is justified by means of a set of recommendations that
each reviewer attach to evaluated proposals. Once a reviewer upload the results of its
evaluation, she/he will see the other evaluations of the same paper delivered by other
reviewers. After deciding about the acceptance or not for all submissions, the authors are
announced by email about their results. Only papers accepted and presented on the
conference will be published. After receiving the acceptance decision, authors are invited
to improve their accepted papers taking into account reviewers recommendations. PC
members excepting the chair/co-chairs can submit proposals by logging as authors. In this
case, they have not the right to see neither which are the reviewers of their paper nor the
comments between reviewers.
The third phase concerns the conference activities - mainly papers' presentation.
Depending on the number of participants and of accepted papers, the conference is
structured on different sections, some of them organized in parallel. Each section is
supervised by a session chair which in the most cases is a member of the Program
Committee (PC member) including the chair/co-chairs. Authors presenting their accepted
papers are named speakers. Participants to each section are: chair, speakers and listeners.
In order to assign the most appropriate rooms for each section, in case of important
conferences (having hundreds of participants) these are invited to specify which are the
sections they intend to participate in. A speaker cannot be the chair of the section in which
she/he present his paper. Usually, before the presentation, speakers upload on the
conference site the content of the presentation by means of a .pdf or .ppt(x) file.
